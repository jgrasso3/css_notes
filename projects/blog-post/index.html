          Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design
          and development! In this exercise, we'll play around with some of the
          common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice
          blog post-like web page.

        <h1>All About Typography</h1>

        <p>
          Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
          reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
          information in a web page. You can use <span>text-transform:</span>
          <span>uppercase;</span> to make a whole body of text uppercase using
          CSS if you really need to grab attention!
        </p>

        <p>
          Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
          you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other
          components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif
          font for our headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text.
          This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
          inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much
          more difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one
          another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings,
          serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it
          easier to see where serif characters start and where they end.
        </p>

        <p>
          But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
          Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
          quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
          it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it
          some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience
          Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way
          that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
          Differentiating our different typography components visually makes
          information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

        <h2>A New Section</h2>

        <p>
          And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a
          <span>hr</span>
          element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't
          putting content together fun?
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice as well that when we entered in the <span>H3</span> content, it
          was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice Title Case, where the first
          letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using
          <span>text-transform: capitalize;</span> we can implement title cased
          content.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h2>

        <h3><span>px</span> (pixels)</h3>
        <p>
          Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default
          the browser sets the root font size to <span>16px</span>, but you can
          change the font size in the <span>body</span> element or any other
          HTML element by setting <span>font-size</span> to any number of
          <span>px</span>.
        </p>

        <h3><span>em</span></h3>
        <p>
          <span>em</span> units size font relative to the parent element. For
          example, if the <span>body</span> element is <span>16px</span>, and a
          nested <span>div</span> element's font size is set to
          <span>1.5em</span>, the browser will multiply 16px x 1.5, resulting in
          <span>24px</span> font in the div.
        </p>

        <h3><span>rem</span> (root em)</h3>
        <p>
          Root <span>em</span> units are similar to <span>em</span>, but they
          are relative to the root font size instead of the parent element of
          whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font
          size of the <span>body</span> element) is set to 16px, and we have a
          <span>p</span> element nested many layers down with a font-size set to
          <span>2rem</span>, that paragraph will have 32px font. If the body
          font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Which one do I use?</h3>
        <p>
          Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using
          <span>em</span> or <span>rem</span> over px, since they make
          responsive typography that scales up and down across different device
          widths much easier. Using <span>px</span> for your font sizes is not
          as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all
          the various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is
          not the most scalable approach to typography.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between <span>em</span> and <span>rem</span>, rem has a nice advantage
          of all elements being relative to one single root font value, where
          nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be
          hard to manage with <span>em</span> units. When writing responsive
          styles, <span>rem</span> allows you to simply update the root font
          size at different screen sizes and all elements using <span>rem</span>
          units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a super
          easy-to-manage typography size system.
        </p>

        <p>
          In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but
          it's always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles
          that may not be responsive or dynamic.
